User can register with username, email, and password.
Optional fields: phone number, address, profile picture.
Captcha for bot prevention.
Validation rules for input fields (e.g., strong password, valid email).
Algorithm:

Validate the input data.
Hash the password using a secure algorithm (e.g., BCrypt).
Save user data to the database with a "pending" email confirmation status.
Generate an email confirmation token and send it to the user's email.
2. Authentication
   Features:

Support for username/email and password-based login.
Account lockout after multiple failed attempts.
Optional multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Algorithm:

Check if the user exists and is active.
Validate the password using the stored hash.
Generate and return an access token (JWT or OAuth2 token) along with a refresh token.
Log the login activity.
3. Change Password
   Features:

Require current password for verification.
Notify the user after a successful password change.
Algorithm:

Authenticate the user using the current password.
Validate the new password (e.g., strength check).
Hash the new password and update the database.
Invalidate all active sessions if applicable.
4. Forgot Password
   Features:

Allow users to request a password reset link via email.
Set a time-limited reset token.
Algorithm:

Generate a unique, time-limited reset token.
Email the reset token link to the user.
On token submission, verify its validity and expiration.
Allow the user to set a new password and update it in the database.
5. Update Profile
   Features:

Users can update details like name, phone number, address, etc.
Algorithm:

Authenticate the user.
Validate the updated data.
Save the changes in the database.
Log the update activity.
6. Change Profile Picture
   Features:

Support for uploading and validating image files.
Store images in a file system, cloud storage, or as a database blob.
Algorithm:

Authenticate the user.
Validate the image file type and size.
Save the image and update the user's profile picture path in the database.
7. Email Confirmation
   Features:

Ensure email is verified before activating the account.
Algorithm:

Send a unique email confirmation link upon registration.
When the user clicks the link, validate the token and mark the email as confirmed in the database.
8. Validate Token
   Features:

Verify if a token is valid and not expired.
Algorithm:

Decode the token and check its signature.
Validate the token against the server's signing key and expiration time.
Ensure the token is not revoked.
9. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   Features:

Define roles (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator).
Restrict access to specific endpoints or features based on roles.
Algorithm:

Assign roles to users during registration or profile update.
Check user roles against required permissions before allowing access.
10. Account Management
    Enable/Disable Account
    Admins can enable or disable accounts for specific users.
    Delete Account
    Users can request account deletion.
    Deactivate Account
    Users can temporarily deactivate their accounts.
    Algorithm for Enable/Disable/Deactivate:

Authenticate the user or verify admin privileges.
Update the account status in the database.
11. Audit Logs
    Features:

Log all user activities like login, updates, and failed attempts.
Algorithm:

Record activities with a timestamp, user ID, and action.
Provide a searchable interface for admins to review logs.
12. Security Measures
    Token Blacklisting: Maintain a blacklist of revoked tokens to prevent reuse.
    Session Timeout: Automatically log out users after a period of inactivity.
    IP Whitelisting/Geofencing: Allow access only from specific IPs or regions.
13. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
    Features:

Add an additional layer of security with OTP via email/SMS or an authenticator app.
Algorithm:

Generate and send an OTP after password validation.
Validate the OTP before issuing access tokens.
14. Social Login Integration
    Features:

Allow users to log in with Google, Facebook, etc.
Algorithm:

Redirect the user to the OAuth provider's login page.
Validate the provider's token and create a local account if needed.
15. Logout
    Features:

Invalidate tokens and terminate active sessions.
Algorithm:

Delete the refresh token from the database.
Mark the access token as invalid.
16. API Rate Limiting
    Features:

Prevent brute-force attacks by limiting login attempts or API calls.
Algorithm:

Track the number of requests from an IP or user.
Block or throttle requests if the limit is exceeded.
17. Email and Notifications
    Features:

Send email notifications for account updates, suspicious logins, etc.
Algorithm:

Use an email queue to send notifications asynchronously.
Log the notification status in the database.
18. Device Management
    Features:

Track and manage devices where the user has logged in.
Algorithm:

Log device details during authentication.
Allow users to view and revoke active sessions.
